HISTORY OF FANDOMGBAR

Me and my friends who are in the GB(gummibar) fandom always wanted our own personal fandom, we knew wiki fandoms existed, but we wanted something else, an art gallery where we can share our arts, public journals where we can share what were working on or whats going on, 2 seprete search bars one for looking up arts and one for looking up profiles, a chat where we can talk in real life chat.

I decided I was going to make this, 1. I was bored. 2. Because I always wanted something like deviantart(art gallery), Facebook(chat) Spacehey(journal)


 MAKING

 it was a little hard, having no coding experence, but after some learning I got it!

 HISTORY OF NAME

 the same isn't that creative the name comes from 2 words Fandom(FANDOM) and Gummibar(GBAR) It was just the first name that i thought of haha

 I was actually gonna code this in codepen.io but i decided not to because 1. the code was in the way. 2. there's a coding limit for free users

 CREATOR

 Hi, I don't usually go by my real name, so just call me Ella or Fenquilly. (Youtube.com/Fenquilly.) I originally joined the GB fandom when I was 5,(Ik young right? XD) I wasn't really IN the fandom, more just like watching Gummibar every single day lol, I got in the whole fandom at 11, I started by re-designing this character I made when I was 3-4. (formely known as Mika) I named her Ella (That's why I go by Ella lol) The youtube was basicly just a random word I made up by just typing random letters. Fenquilly then became my favorite name to go by on youtube (besides Ella)


 That's the end of my boring text, thanks! (The text down below will be updates whenever I update this)
